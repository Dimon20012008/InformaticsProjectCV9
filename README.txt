Name of project: "Krivoy Chertila"

Description: it is a game, where you need to draw a contour in the air with your finger

Installation and launch: make sure to have all libraries from requirements.txt, start main.py

Usage: make sure, that your index finger is on the contour and there's a blue circle, which detects your finger.
Make sure, that you can draw the whole contour. Distancing away from camera always works.
Show camera only one hand, otherwise it won't properly work.
Press any key on the keyboard and follow the contour. When you return to the start (yellow circle) a score appears.

Completeness of project: want to add more contours and their shuffle, color of your path changes, as you get farther from contour.
